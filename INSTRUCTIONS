Things to do at the beginning of a year:
- Update scripts/WeekVars.txt
- Update index.html to include the previous years champions and new rule info
- Add the new year as a dropdown option in standings.html and make it the default
- Add the new year (and previous playoffs) as options in leaders.html
- Add rows to the "Leagues" table for each of the new leagues
- Uncoment the /etc/crontab lines for OTH (only do this the day the season starts)
- Finally, run "UpdateTables.py" to grab all of the teams from each league (once the leagues are filled) -- normally this runs sunday night
