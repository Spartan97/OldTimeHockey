These instructions are specifically for people who want to work on the frontend -- the html and css of the site. PM SPRX97 on Discord before you start, but changes to this should be relatively easy to make
and low risk. This should work on linux or windows environments.

Part 1: Fork git repository
- FORK my git repo from the github website.
- Clone your new fork using "git clone"

Part 2: Make a minor change and commit
- Make a minor change and commit/push to your fork of the project
- On github, create a new pull request fore your change
- Contact SPRX to review/merge the pull request
