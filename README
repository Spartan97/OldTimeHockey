This is a repository for all things /r/OldTimeHockey.

Things that exist somewhere in this git repo:
- Code for all pages of www.roldtimehockey.com
- Code for the reddit bot that posts weekly updates.
- Code that scrapes the leagues on fleaflicker and stores it in a database
- Code for our Discord bot, Wes

Things that are part of the project, but not on the site (yet):
- The actual sql databases containing all the scraped data
- The cron jobs that continually run these scrips to keep the database fresh
