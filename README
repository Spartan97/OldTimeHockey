This is a repository for all things /r/OldTimeHockey.

Things that exist somewhere in this git repo:
- Code for all pages of www.roldtimehockey.com
- Code for the reddit bot that posts weekly updates
- Code that scrapes the leagues on fleaflicker and stores it in a database
- Code for our Discord bot, Wes

Things that are part of the project, but not on the site (yet):
- The actual sql databases containing all the scraped data
- The cron jobs that continually run these scrips to keep the database fresh

Other notes:
- Most of the python stuff requries Python3 to run
- The database is a standard mysql installation
- Everything is depoyed from a DigitalOcean droplet running Ubuntu 14.04 x64
- The droplet takes weekly backups in case of catastrophic failure
- After making changes to DiscordBot.py or the related modules, 
  make sure to kill the python3 process running DiscordBot on the server.
  The forever.js script will automatically restart it and pick up
  the new changes.
